## The project

The goal of the project was to create a personal and professional portfolio, that we will keep for the future.

There are multiple features :

-   The _home_ page, introducing visitors to me and my most recent works
-   The _portfolio_ page, referencing all the works that I have done
-   The _skills_ page, showing off every programming technology that I am able to use
-   The _about_ page, to know more about me and my journey
-   The _contact_ page, if visitors want to contact me

## The technologies

The project was coded using React for the front-end, Next.js for the back-end, and the framework Tailwind for the CSS
